🌱 Crop Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental conditions like temperature, humidity, pH level, and rainfall. It compares multiple machine learning models and evaluates their performance using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

📌 Features
Predicts best crop based on 7 key features

Compares 6 ML models:

KNN

Decision Tree

Logistic Regression

SVM

Naive Bayes

Random Forest

Shows:

Accuracy & training time comparison

Confusion matrices

Feature importance visualization (Random Forest)

Clean evaluation using a reusable evaluate_model() function

📂 Dataset
Columns used: N, P, K, temperature, humidity, ph, rainfall, label

[Optional: Link to the dataset or mention source like Kaggle]

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn
